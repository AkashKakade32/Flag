The Ashoka Chakra has 24 spokes which represent 24 qualities of a person. The Ashoka chakra is also known as Samay Chakra in which the 24 spokes represent 24 hours of the day and is the symbol of the movement of the time. It is called the wheel of duty, and signifies that there is life in movement and death in stagnation.
